# weather-model
A weather model created with python
The Plan:
First try to create a basic weather model using python to get the basic data and from there we can work our way to make a model that is aprticualry efficient with predicting/identifying severe weather events as that is my ultimate goal. We can then try to make this into an app of some sort with a GUI and it could be a physical app or just a web browser version.
